# Introduction
## Stardrop is an efficient web transfer tool with the following features:
- Stardrop allows quick file transfer without the need for a client or account.
- Stardrop can be configured to automatically delete files after a timeout, effectively preventing attackers from maliciously transferring large files to fill up the server's hard disk.
- Administrators can efficiently manage the service using Stardrop's configuration file.
- Stardrop supports file size limitation to prevent insufficient disk space.

## üîÆ Use Cases
### When you want to send a file to a colleague without adding them on a messaging platform, you can upload the file to Stardrop and share the verification code for easy file transfer.
